          <p class="section-description m-t-1 fade-in">My portfolio project and course work for Vilnius Gediminas Technical University. The goal of this project is to develop a web application that facilitates the process of buying flight tickets online, providing a convenient and efficient alternative to traditional methods. I wrote the backend on Python and the frontend using Vite (React+TypeScript). This project has a responsive design, and includes payments via Stripe. Here, users can filter, book, search for flights, view tickets and admins can manage flights, check the validity of tickets and more.</p>

          <p class="section-description m-t-1 fade-in">MDevCode is the name of my service, which provides various web projects from scratch to the final working product. Here, I create designs and fully implement both the visible part (frontend) and the complete application logic (backend). I also develop mobile applications for iOS and Android.
            <br/><br/>
            In this job, I independently created a website for a client from scratch (backend and frontend) called GemWiz (about diamonds). The technologies used for the backend were Node.js and TypeScript, and for the frontend, I used Vite with React and TypeScript, as well as Tailwind and ReactQuery. The data is stored in a MongoDB database.
            <br/><br/>
            The project was deployed on a server using Nginx, and domains and subdomains were also used.
            <br/><br/>
            The project has many features, one of the main ones being the display and filtering of diamonds. It includes checking diamond information using a diamond ID, implementing payment subscriptions, and viewing detailed information about specific diamonds.</p>

          <p class="section-description m-t-1 fade-in">At this company, I worked as a middle full-stack developer. I spent a year here and gained a lot of experience and valuable skills. I worked on projects both independently and in teams. The technologies I worked with included Stripe, SendGrid, Mailjet, CarVertical, Klaviyo, electrical charging stations, and more. I used languages and frameworks such as Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Kotlin, and React, and worked with various databases like MySQL and MongoDB, as well as virtual storage for photos like AWS.

            <br/><br/>
            You might be familiar with applications like Delite, Cheatlife, CarLogger, and autoPiLDYK; these were the main projects I worked on, where I enhanced or added new functionalities. I worked with the team on developing the new version of CarLogger, particularly on the backend. I also worked on the charging functionalities in autoPiLDYK and updated the payment system, using new technologies like Stripe, which allowed adding payment cards, maintaining balances, and topping up balances using added cards. Webhooks were used for more precise balance management.
            <br/><br/>
            I have experience with process automation and performance improvement by refining code, projects, and user experience. I also performed code refactoring where needed in older codebases.
            <br/><br/>
            Writing tests was essential in each project. I edited, fixed, and improved some tests, while adding new ones to existing systems. For example, in autoPiLDYK, I wrote the test system from scratch, testing existing functionalities and adding new ones. The testing techniques I used included Mocha, Chai, and Supertest, which help automate the testing process.
            <br/><br/>
            This job enhanced my coding skills, and I adhered to best practices and advice from more experienced team members. I read a lot of documentation and books, continuously learning and developing, as there is always much to explore and learn in this field.</p>
